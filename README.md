## Homework 4 - Homographies
## part 1 - Theory
## part 2 - Planar Homographies:
          * Manual finding corresponding points.
          * Calculate transformation.
          * Image warping.
          * Panorama stitching.
          * Autonomous panorama stitching using SIFT.
          * Compare SIFT and Manuale image selection.
          * RANSAC.
## part 3 - Creating your Augmented Reality application:
          * Create reference model.
          * Implant an image inside another image.
          * Creativity Section.
          
NOTE: there was no use in OpenCV/Scipy or any other "ready to use" functions when we were asked to implement a function.
